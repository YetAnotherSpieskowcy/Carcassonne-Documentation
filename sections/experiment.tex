\section{Experiment design}
This research aims to answer the following question:
What level of play does the agent based on reinforcement learning achieve compared to random and greedy players?
The team hypothesis was that the agent based on reinforcement learning will be 
able to achieve better results than an agent using naive tree search algorithms 
both against human and computer random players. The criterion of success was 
measured as an average points scored by the agent.
During the research, the team conducted a series of simulations and real-time experiments. 
The first method was used to run games between computer agents, while the second 
- between the agent and human players.  All the games were stored as logs 
which allowed us to easily reconstruct the games and strategies.

\section{Results}

The experiment results are presented as a chart\ref{fig:Results} containing the amount of 
points each agent was able to get while playing against the other agents. The agents are
RandomAgent, GreedyAgent, RLAgent.

The above mentioned results show that the engine's performance issues heavily
impacted the ability of the agent based on reinforcement learning to learn the game.
Based on this results team decided the next steps should be to improve the engine's
throughput as to increase the learning rate of the agent.
